# The Note Taker
    This Note Taker is a project by Tae Chung, to help 
    students across the internet retain their information.

# Credits
    Technologies used: JavasScript, HTML, JSON, MySQL, 
    MySQL, Workbench

# Development 1
    First, the start-code (HTML files) served as the foundation 
    for the website. And then we ran "npm install" to fetch
    the necessary files. We then made a ".gitignore" file so as 
    to not flood github with excessive commits.

# Development 2
    (TA) Dennis Itua assisted with further 'app.' code and error patches, i.e. 
    missing brackets, semi-colons, parentheses. 

# Development 3
    (TA) Charlie Puente assisted in inspecting the deployed page and 
    helped put in route code.

# How to Use
    Simply type the title of the topic on the "Note Title" section 
    and take notes on the "Note Text" section. After finishing, 
    press the floppy disk sign to save the notes.
    If unneeded, press the red garbage icon to delete the notes
